> [!NOTE]
> Focusrite discontinued MixControl years ago. On modern macOS the app still launches but no longer finds the device — so the matrix mixer, routing, and DSP features your hardware actually has are unreachable. If you own a 1st-gen Scarlett 8i6 and want to use those features again on a modern Mac, this is for you.

## 📦 Installation

### Download a release _(recommended)_

1. Grab `Scarlett.MixControl.app.zip` from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen/releases/latest).
2. Unzip and drag `Scarlett MixControl.app` to `/Applications`.
3. **First launch only** — macOS Gatekeeper will block the app (we use ad-hoc codesigning, not a paid Developer ID). One of these will get past it:
   - **Right-click** the app → **Open** → confirm the warning dialog.
   - Or in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Scarlett MixControl.app"`

### Build from source

Requires the Xcode 15 / Swift 5.9+ toolchain.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen.git
cd scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen
./scripts/make-app.sh
open "build/Scarlett MixControl.app"
```

For dev iteration without packaging: `swift run scarlett-app`. There's also a `scarlett-cli` companion for low-level protocol poking — try `swift run scarlett-cli --help`.

| **Scarlett 8i6** _(1st gen)_ | ✅ &nbsp; Officially supported — tested on macOS 14+ |
| Scarlett 18i8 _(1st gen)_    | 🟢 &nbsp; Beta — driven; awaiting hardware confirmation |
| Scarlett 18i6 _(1st gen)_    | 🟢 &nbsp; Beta — driven; awaiting hardware confirmation |
| Scarlett 18i20 _(1st gen)_   | 🟢 &nbsp; Beta — driven; awaiting hardware confirmation |
| Scarlett 6i6 _(1st gen)_     | 🟢 &nbsp; Beta — driven; awaiting hardware confirmation |
| Scarlett 16i8 _(1st gen)_    | ⚪ &nbsp; Prototype SKU — no shipping USB ID to detect |
| Scarlett 2nd / 3rd / 4th gen | ❌ &nbsp; Different protocol — won't work            |
| Saffire (FireWire) family    | ❌ &nbsp; Different transport — won't work           |

> 🟢 Every shipping 1st-gen USB Scarlett is now driven with byte tables extracted from the original MixControl binary. Only the **8i6** has been confirmed on real hardware so far — the rest are wired up but need an owner to verify. Grab a [pre-release](https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen/releases) and [open an issue](https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen/issues) if anything's off.

## 🛠️ How it works

<details>
<summary><strong>Tech tour (click to expand)</strong></summary>

<br/>

The 1st-gen Scarletts are **USB Audio Class 2.0** devices. macOS's built-in `usbaudiod` claims the audio + MIDI streaming interfaces, but doesn't touch the **audio control interface** (endpoint 0). That's how this app coexists with normal audio playback — every mixer / routing / metering command is a `IOUSBDeviceInterface.DeviceRequest` to endpoint 0, sent through the same USB stack `usbaudiod` is using, without ever issuing `USBDeviceOpen` (which would fail with `kIOReturnExclusiveAccess`).

The protocol itself was reverse-engineered by extracting the per-product signal tables (`_USB14Tracker_IpSigTab`, `_USB14Tracker_OpSigTab`, default routing tables, etc.) directly from the original MixControl 1.10.6 binary, then disassembling key dispatch functions (`MacHWDevice::routeChannel`, `setMonMono`, etc.) to confirm `wValue` / `wIndex` semantics.

**The three routing dimensions:**

| `wIndex` | Purpose                   | UI surface                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `0x3200` | Matrix-mixer input source | Source picker on each matrix channel strip |
| `0x3300` | Physical output routing   | "Output assignments" panel in Routing tab  |
| `0x3400` | USB capture routing       | "USB capture" panel in Routing tab         |

**Firmware quirks worth knowing:**

- Routing GETs always return `00 00` regardless of what was last set — UserDefaults persistence is the only way to remember routes across launches.
- Matrix-source assignment silently fails if the source is already wired to another channel — the app does an explicit `.off` disconnect on the previous owner first.
- The `setMonitorMono` USB command crashes the firmware when sent from our process, even with byte-perfect parity to MixControl. Probably an undocumented authorization handshake at startup we haven't identified — the Mn button is hidden until we crack it.

For full deep-dive, read the commit history — `d175367` (the matrix-mixer breakthrough) and `1294ff7` (feature parity additions) cover most of the protocol reasoning.

## 🤝 Contributing

Every shipping 1st-gen USB Scarlett (8i6, 18i6, 18i8, 18i20, 6i6) now has a `DeviceProfile` with byte tables extracted from MixControl's binary, and the app will drive all of them. The remaining open item is **hardware validation** — only the 8i6 has been confirmed on a real unit. If you own one of the others:

1. Grab a [pre-release](https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen/releases) and connect your device.
2. Check that inputs/outputs are labelled correctly, faders move the right channels, and meters track the right signals.
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/MarecekW/scarlett-mixcontrol-1stgen/issues/new) with anything that's wrong — that's exactly the feedback that promotes a device from 🟢 beta to ✅ confirmed.

(There's also a non-shipping "16i8" table in the MixControl binary, but it has no USB product ID in the firmware's device dispatch, so there's no hardware to detect.)
